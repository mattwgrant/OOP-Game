This project creates a game, Phrase Hunter, using Object Oriented Programming with
JavaScript. Using classes, constructors, and methods, the game randomly generates
a phrase. The player, using the onscreen keyboard, must guess the letters in the 
phrase before having five incorrect letter guesses to win. If they guess five incorrect
letters, the game is over. Whether they win or lose, the board is overlayed with a
message telling them the outcome and a Start Game button to play again. The board is 
cleared and hearts are restored after the game ends so that there is a clean board
every time a new game is started.
